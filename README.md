Fragmentation Analysis is a key check used by mining engineers after blasting to determine the efficacy of blast or blast accuracy. It focuses on checking the average size of rocks/fragments generated after blast, This is a image processing / computer vision approach using Holistically Nested Edge Detection Algorithm (HED)
